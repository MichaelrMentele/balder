* session planning

There are two parts to being a DM. The first part is telling the story through time and stringing sessions together. The second is building a graph of people, places, events, and encounters that your heroes can travel down.

Your party travels through a graph of options. Those options are defined by a location. So your options should be based on the location you are in. However, those options can move between locations. You need to be able to update information for a location and move monsters, information, and items to new locations.

You may also have a "clipboard" of drop in encounters that aren't tied to a location because you want to bring them anywhere and stall or reveal something new. Maybe you want time jumping plane jumping monsters that strike randomly at any moment!

Still, any good world has a baseline, a backbone that is location based. Now you need to figure out how plot and character development weave into this. Maybe only certain paths can be traversed when certain events can happen. Character development may be able to take place anywhere.

There is an initial state:
* the world in the begining of the story (you)
* the characters in the begining of the story (them)
* the characters develop
* the world develops

Then you conclude the story and it ends. This journey is organized into a sequence of sessions of play.

# Build your world's initial state
* build your locations
* set a starting point

# Build your character development paths
* drop in encounters, triggered effects on the world (maybe a location only they can unlock)
* custom grants & classes
* unlockables, traits, and items

# Build your world development paths
This is also called a plot, but it's what is happening external to the characters. What unlocks? What paths can the party take? What are their options? These triggers determine what happens to the world. It might open new locations or close them.

# Session Planning
Now our session comes down to two things:
* character development
* world development

That is all! These developments are organized into encounters.
